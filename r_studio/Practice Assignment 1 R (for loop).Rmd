#A for loop is used to generate a list of numbers as long as the condition in the bracket is met. The R code, as shown below, will print all integers between 1 to 10. In this case, 'i' is the variable and we want to retrieve each i-value which is between 1 to 10. The loop will end once all the conditions are met. 


for (i in 1:10){
  print (i)
}
